Differences

Service class uses the application's main thread, while IntentService creates a worker thread and uses that thread to run 
  the service.
IntentService creates a queue that passes one intent at a time to onHandleIntent(). Thus, implementing a multi-thread should
  be made by extending Service class directly. Service class needs a manual stop using stopSelf(). Meanwhile, IntentService 
  automatically stops itself when it finishes execution.
IntentService implements onBind() that returns null. This means that the IntentService can not be bound by default.
IntentService implements onStartCommand() that sends Intent to queue and to onHandleIntent().
In brief, there are only two things to do to use IntentService. Firstly, to implement the constructor. And secondly,
to implement onHandleIntent(). For other callback methods, the super is needed to be called so that it can be tracked properly.
