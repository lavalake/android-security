1. A task is the sequence of activities the user follows to accomplish an objective, regardless of which applications the activities belong to.
2. It's notable that these activities can be in any application — that is, all in the same application or in different ones. 
 That is, a task that starts out in contacts can continue, by choosing an email address, to an email activity and then, 
 by attaching a file, to a picture gallery to pick from. Contacts, email and picture gallery are all separate applications.
3. When writing an activity that won't be re-used, don't specify intent filters — use explicit intents

If you're writing an activity that you don't want other activities to use, be sure not to add any intent filters to that 
activity. This applies to an activity that will be launched only from the application launcher or from other activities 
inside your application. Instead, just create intents specifying the explicit component to launch — that is, explicit intents.
In this case, there's just no need for intent filters. Intent filters are published to all other applications, so if you make 
an intent filter, what you're doing is publishing access to your activity, which means you can cause unintentional security 
holes.
