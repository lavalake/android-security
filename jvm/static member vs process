java static variable and process
No. The static variable is specific to the JVM instance. More than that, in fact - it's specific to the class loader which 
loads the class. So if you created three separate class loaders, each responsible for loading MyClass 
(not just delegating to some common parent) they'd each have a separate, independent static variable in MyClass
