onPause() execution is very brief, and does not necessarily afford enough time to perform save operations. For this reason,
you should not use onPause() to save application or user data, make network calls, or execute database transactions; 
such work may not complete before the method completes. Instead, you should perform heavy-load shutdown operations during onStop

In the onStop() method, the app should release or adjust resources that are not needed while the app is not visible to the user.
For example, your app might pause animations or switch from fine-grained to coarse-grained location updates. 

You should also use onStop() to perform relatively CPU-intensive shutdown operations. For example, if you can't find a more 
opportune time to save information to a database, you might do so during onStop(). The following example shows an 
implementation of onStop() that saves the contents of a draft note to persistent storage:

Likelihood of being killed	    Process state	                    Activity state
Least	            Foreground (having or about to get focus)	        Created
                                                                    Started
                                                                    Resumed
More	                    Background (lost focus)	                  Paused
Most	                    Background (not visible)	                Stopped
                                    Empty	                          Destroyed
                                    
The system never kills an activity directly to free up memory. Instead, it kills the process in which the activity runs
