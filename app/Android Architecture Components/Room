The library helps you create a cache of your app's data on a device that's running your app. This cache, which serves as your
app's single source of truth, allows users to view a consistent copy of key information within your app, regardless of
whether users have an internet connection.

Apps that handle non-trivial amounts of structured data can benefit greatly from persisting that data locally

There are 3 major components in Room:
  1. Database: Contains the database holder and serves as the main access point for the underlying connection to 
    your app's persisted, relational data
  2. Entity: Represents a table within the database
  3. DAO: Contains the methods used for accessing the database.
  
Note: You should follow the singleton design pattern when instantiating an AppDatabase object, as each RoomDatabase instance 
is fairly expensive, and you rarely need access to multiple instances
