Most of the app components that are defined in the Android Framework have lifecycles attached to them. Lifecycles are managed 
by the operating system or the framework code running in your process

A class can monitor the component's lifecycle status by adding annotations to its methods. Then you can add an observer by 
calling the addObserver() method of the Lifecycle class and passing an instance of your observer, as shown in the following example:

LifecycleOwner
  LifecycleOwner is a single method interface that denotes that the class has a Lifecycle. It has one method, getLifecycle(), 
  which must be implemented by the class.If you're trying to manage the lifecycle of a whole application process instead, see ProcessLifecycleOwner
