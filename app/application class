The representation of an executing application in Java is the android.app.Applica
tion object, which is instantiated upon application start and destroyed when the ap‐
plication stops (i.e., an instance of the Application class lasts for the lifetime of the
Linux process of the application). When the process is terminated and restarted, a new
Application instance is created

Components
Activity , Service , BroadcastReceiver , and ContentProvider
The config‐uration and interaction of these components define the application’s behavior. These
entities have different responsibilities and lifecycles, but they all represent application
entry points, where the application can be started

Explicit Intent
Defines the fully classified name of the component, which is known within the
application at compile time
Implicit Intent
A runtime binding to a component that has defined a set of characteristics in an
IntentFilter . If the Intent matches the characteristics of a component’s Intent
Filter , the component can be started
