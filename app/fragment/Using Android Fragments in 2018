The solution is simple — just don’t do it :-). Do not put any kind of this business logic and asynchronous work into your
fragments since it will never play well with the Fragment/Activity lifecycle. ViewModel is the place where you want to 
put that code.

They’re kept inside headless retained Fragments during the orientation change. Pretty neat. But for the love of God, don’t 
use Retained Fragments in regular screens. They’re not really meant to be used with an actual UI.

The Fragment or Activity should just have the responsibility of displaying the data and capturing/forwarding the user input.
