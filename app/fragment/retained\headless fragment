  setRetainInstance(true): The Fragment's state will be retained (and not destroyed!) across configuration changes
  (e.g. screen rotate). The state will be retained 
  even if the configuration change causes the "parent" Activity to be destroyed. However, the view of the Fragment gets destroyed!

Lifecycle Calls:

  onPause() -> onStop() -> onDestroyView() -> onDetach()
  onAttach() -> onCreateView() -> onStart() -> onResume()

setRetainInstance(true) is especially useful for long running operations inside Fragments which do not care about configuration changes
For Example, some background downloading task not affected by configuration chagne.

ViewModel VS Fragment
  basis of ViewModelProviders that provides the ViewModel to store data across configuration changes is, none other than, 
  setRetainInstance(true)
