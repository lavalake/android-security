There are two types of FCM messages you can choose from:

Notification Messages, which simplify notification handling and are high priority by default.
Data Messages, for when you want to handle the FCM messages within the client app.

 For example, a common use case for a normal priority FCM Data Message is to tell the app when there's content ready for sync,
 which requires no user interaction. The sync should happen quietly in the background, with no need for a notification, and you
 can use the WorkManager1 or JobScheduler API to schedule the sync.
 
 The same applies to data sync--we recommend that your app send as much data as possible in the FCM payload and, if needed, 
 load the remainder of the data when the app opens
 
 As convenient as FCM message payload is, it comes with a 4KB maximum limit.you may need more than the 4KB payload limit. 
 For this, we recommend using FCM messages in combination with the WorkManager 1 or JobScheduler API.
 
 Avoid background services
  Starting a background service will lead to IllegalStateException from a normal priority FCM message
  High priority messages do grant you a short whitelist window that allows you to start a background service.
  However, starting a background service with a network call will put the service at risk of getting terminated by the system

Handle FCM messages on Android
  When using an FCM notification message, the system handles showing the notification on behalf of 
  your app when it's in the background
  
   When your app is in the foreground, the FCM notification message is delivered to the onMessageReceived()handler
   and you can handle it by posting a notification if needed or update the app content with the FCM payload data (Max 4KB)
   or fetch content from app server.
 Data Message
 You should use data messages if you need to handle the notification in the client app, whether to customize the notification
 or to decrypt the received payload data.
