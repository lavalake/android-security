A task is a collection of activities that users interact with when performing a certain job in the order in which each activity is opened
The device Home screen is the starting place for most tasks

Task Stack
  all the activities in the task are stopped, but the back stack for the task remains intactâ€”the task has simply lost focus while
  another task takes place

Multiple instance of same activity
  one activity in your app might be instantiated multiple times (even from different tasks)
  if the user navigates backward using the Back button, each instance of the activity is revealed in the order they were opened
  (each with their own UI state)
  
launchMode
  standard
  singleTop
  singleTask
  singleInstance
  
  if you start an activity that specifies the singleTask launch mode, then if an instance of that activity exists in a 
  background task, that whole task is brought to the foreground. At this point, the back stack now includes all activities 
  from the task brought forward, at the top of the stack
  
Handling affinities
  The affinity indicates which task an activity prefers to belong to. By default, all the activities from the same app have 
  an affinity for each other.Activities defined in different apps can share an affinity, or activities defined in the 
  same app can be assigned different task affinities
  
Starting a task

  You can set up an activity as the entry point for a task by giving it an intent filter with "android.intent.action.MAIN" 
  as the specified action and "android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"
  An intent filter of this kind causes an icon and label for the activity to be displayed in the app launcher
  
  This second ability is important: Users must be able to leave a task and then come back to it later using this activity launcher. For this reason, the two launch modes that mark activities as always initiating a task, "singleTask" and "singleInstance", should be used only when the activity has an ACTION_MAIN and a CATEGORY_LAUNCHER filter
