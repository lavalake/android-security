Lock screen notifications

1. Start an Activity from a Notification
When you start an activity from a notification, you must preserve the user's expected navigation experience. 
Tapping Back should take the user back through the app's normal work flow to the Home screen, and opening 
the Recents screen should show the activity as a separate task.

2. Set up a regular activity PendingIntent
To start a "regular activity" from your notification, set up the PendingIntent using TaskStackBuilder 
so that it creates a new back stack as follows.
<!-- MainActivity is the parent for ResultActivity -->
<activity
    android:name=".ResultActivity"
    android:parentActivityName=".MainActivity" />
    ...
</activity>
  Build a PendingIntent with a back stack
    To start an activity that includes a back stack of activities, you need to create an instance of 
    TaskStackBuilder and call addNextIntentWithParentStack(), passing it the Intent for the activity you want to start.
    // Create an Intent for the activity you want to start
    Intent resultIntent = new Intent(this, ResultActivity.class);
    // Create the TaskStackBuilder and add the intent, which inflates the back stack
    TaskStackBuilder stackBuilder = TaskStackBuilder.create(this);
    stackBuilder.addNextIntentWithParentStack(resultIntent);
    // Get the PendingIntent containing the entire back stack
    PendingIntent resultPendingIntent =
        stackBuilder.getPendingIntent(0, PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT);
