Separation of concerns
  minimize your dependency on Activity and Fragment
Drive UI from a model
  Models are components that are responsible for handling the data for an app
  They're independent from the View objects and app components in your app
  so they're unaffected by the app's lifecycle and the associated concerns
  
  Persistence is ideal for the following reasons:
    Your users don't lose data if the Android OS destroys your app to free up resources.
    Your app continues to work in cases when a network connection is flaky or not available.

  Notice that each component depends only on the component one level below it. For example, activities and fragments depend 
  only on a view model. The repository is the only class that depends on multiple other classes; in this example, 
  the repository depends on a persistent data model and a remote backend data source
