App A starts with Activity A1, which sets up some state in the Application object.
Activity A1 starts Activity A2, which uses the state in the Application object.
Activity A2 fires an Intent for Activity B1 of App B and expects some result (lets say we fired an Intent asking for an image 
to be captured by the camera app).
App B starts, and launches Activity B1.
Activity B1 is memory-heavy, so the system shuts down App A (completely kills its process), even though it is on the back-stack waiting for a result.
Activity B1 returns, app A's Application object is created, Activity A2 is started again but Activity A1 never launched in the 
lifetime of this Application object so does not get the opportunity to set up the state of the Application object.
