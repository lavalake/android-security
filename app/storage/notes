1. how to presist data even app uninstalled?
2. internal vs external storage
  For example, if your app allows users to capture photos, the user would expect that they can access those photos even
  after they uninstall your app. So you should instead save those types of files to the public external storage.
3. Internal cache files
  Each app has a private cache directory specifically for these kinds of files
  You should always maintain the cache files yourself and stay within a reasonable limit of space consumed, such as 1MB
4. external storage
  Most often, you should use external storage for user data that should be accessible to other apps and saved even if 
  the user uninstalls your app, such as captured photos or downloaded files
  public files: not deleted
  private files: deleted
5. sharedPreference
  If you don't need to store a lot of data and it doesn't require structure, you should use SharedPreferences. 
  read and write persistent key-value pairs of primitive data types: booleans, floats, ints, longs, and strings
  do not call apply in UI thread. It's synchronos and could blocking
  getDefaultSharedPreferences is used for APP settings
6. Room persistence library
