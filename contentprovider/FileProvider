In comparison, to control access to a file:/// Uri you have to modify the file system permissions of the underlying file. 
The permissions you provide become available to any app, and remain in effect until you change them. 
This level of access is fundamentally insecure.

The increased level of file access security offered by a content URI makes FileProvider a key part of Android's security 
infrastructure.
