The Loader framework offers a robust way to run asynchronous operations with content
providers or other data sources. The framework can load data asynchronously and
deliver it to your application when content changes or is added to the data source.

Asynchronous data management
  The loader reacts in the background to the data source and triggers a callback in
  your app when the data source has new data.
Lifecycle management
  When your Activity or Fragment stops, its loader stops as well. Furthermore,
  loaders that are running in the background continue to do their work after config‐
  uration changes, such as an orientation change.
Cached data
  If the result of an asynchronous data load can’t be delivered, it is cached so that it
  can be delivered when there is a recipient ready—e.g., when an Activity is recre‐
  ated due to a configuration change
Leak protection
  If an Activity undergoes a configuration change, the Loader framework ensures
  that the Context object is not lost to a leak. The framework operates only on the
  Application context so that major thread-related leaks don’t occur
  
LoaderManager
  The LoaderManager is an abstract class that manages all loaders used by an Activity or a Fragment
