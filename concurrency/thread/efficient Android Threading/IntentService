The IntentService has the properties
of the Service lifecycle but also adds built-in task processing on a background thread

The background task executor in the IntentService is a Handler
Thread . Unlike the default executor in AsyncTask , the IntentService executor is per instance and not per application

So an applica‐tion can have multiple IntentService instances, where every instance executes tasks sequentially 
but independent of other IntentService instances

*Good Ways to Use an IntentService*
The IntentService is suitable for when you want to offload tasks easily from the UI
thread to a background thread with sequential task processing, giving the task a com‐
ponent that is always active in order to raise the process rank
