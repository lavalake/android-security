Interruptions
  Occasionally, an application wants to terminate the thread’s execution before it has
  finished its task. For instance, if a thread is taking a long time to download a video and
  the user presses a button to cancel the download, the UI thread captures the button
  press and would like to terminate the downloading thread. There is, however, no way
  a thread can be directly terminated. Instead, threads can be interrupted, which is a
  request to the thread that is should terminate, but it is the thread itself that determines
  whether to oblige or not. Interruptions are invoked on the thread reference:
    Thread t = new SimpleThread();
    t.start(); // Start the thread
    t.interrupt(); // Request interruption
  The interrupt flag is also supported by most blocking methods and libraries; a thread
  that is currently blocked will throw an InterruptedException upon being interrupted.

Handling InterruptedException
  When an InterruptedException is thrown, the interrupted flag
  is reset—for example, isInterrupted will return false even though the thread has been
  interrupted. This may lead to problems further up in the thread callstack because no
  one will know that the thread has been interrupted. So if the thread doesn’t have to
  perform any cleanup upon interruption, the thread should pass the InterruptedExcep
  tion further up in the callstack. If cleanup is required, it should be done in the catch-
  clause, after which the thread should interrupt itself again so that callers of the executed
  method are aware of the interruption, as shown in the following example:
  void myMethod() {
    try {
    // Some blocking call
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
    // 1. Clean up
    // 2. Interrupt again
    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
    }
  }
  
Unhandled Exceptions on the UI Thread
  The Android runtime attaches a process global UncaughtExceptionHandler when an
  application is started. 1 Thus, the exception handler is attached to all threads in the ap‐
  plication, and it treats unhandled exceptions equally for all threads: the process is killed.

Thread Management
  Each application is responsible for the threads it uses and how they are managed. An
  application should decide on the number of threads to use, how to reuse them, when
  to interrupt them, and if they should be retained during a rotation change.
  You can implement these qualities throughout the lifecycle of the thread, particularly
  at three phases: definition and start, retention, and cancellation.
  
Definition and Start
  We will now look into the most common ways of defining and starting
  worker threads on Android and observe the implications of each one
Retention
  Once a thread is started,
  it will execute until either its run method finishes or the whole application process
  terminates. Therefore, the thread lifetime can outlive the component lifetime
  When the thread finishes, it may have produced a result that was meant to be used by
  the component, but there is no receiver available. Typically, this situation occurs on
  configuration changes in Activity components. The default behavior is to restart the
  component when its configuration has changed, meaning that the original Activity
  object is replaced by a new one without any knowledge of the executing background
  thread. 2 Only the Activity object that started the thread knows that the thread was
  started, so the new Activity cannot utilize the thread’s result; it has to restart the thread
  over again to collect the data.
  
*Retaining a thread in an Activity*
  The Activity class contains two methods for handling thread retention
  public Object onRetainNonConfigurationInstance()
    Called by the platform before a configuration change occurs
  public Object getLastNonConfigurationInstance()
    Called in the new Activity object to retrieve the retained object returned in onRe
    tainNonConfigurationInstance() after a configuration change has been made
    
Retaining a thread in a Fragment
  The Fragment can be added to an Activity just to handle thread retention, without containing any UI elements. In a
  Fragment , all that is required to retain a thread, or any other state, is to call setRetai
  nInstance(true) in Fragment.onCreate() . The Fragment is then retained during a
  configuration change. The actual Fragment lifecycle is changed so that it does not get
  destroyed during configuration changes
