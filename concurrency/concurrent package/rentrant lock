More flexible, scalable locking in JDK 5.0

Extended capabilities of reentrant lock include :-

The ability to have more than one condition variable per monitor. Monitors that use the synchronized keyword can only have one. This means reentrant locks support more than one wait()/notify() queue.
The ability to make the lock "fair". "[fair] locks favor granting access to the longest-waiting thread. Otherwise this lock does not guarantee any particular access order." Synchronized blocks are unfair.
The ability to check if the lock is being held.
The ability to get the list of threads waiting on the lock.
