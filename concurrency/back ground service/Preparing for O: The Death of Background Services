Background Service Limitations
https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/background
android 8.0 places limitations on what apps can do while users aren't directly interacting with them. Apps are restricted in two ways:
  1. Background Service Limitations: While an app is idle, there are limits to its use of background services. 
    This does not apply to foreground services, which are more noticeable to the user
  2. Broadcast Limitations: With limited exceptions, apps cannot use their manifest to register for implicit broadcasts.
    They can still register for these broadcasts at runtime, and they can use the manifest to register for explicit 
    broadcasts targeted specifically at their app
  3. using JobScheduler jobs. This approach lets an app arrange to perform work when the app isn't actively running
Background Service Limitations
  The system distinguishes between foreground and background apps.
