Scheduling Work Within Your Application Process
  Handler Timer and Thread
Using the AlarmManager to Schedule Tasks at the System Level
  AlarmManager allows an application to schedule tasks that may need to run or repeat beyond the scope of its lifecycle
Job Scheduler
  JobScheduler helps perform background work in an efficient way, especially networking
GCM Network Manager
  GCMNetworkManager has all of the nice battery saving schedule features from JobScheduler, but the backwards compatibility and simplicity 
  of its Service counterpart will make it more appealing to most developers
Sync Adapter
  Sync Adapters were introduced with the intent of keeping Android devices and servers in sync
  Syncs could be triggered from data changes in either the server or device, or by elapsed time and time of day
  The system will try to batch outgoing syncs to preserve battery life, and transfers that are unable to run 
  will queue up for transfer at a later time. The system will attempt syncs only when the device is connected to a network
Doze Mode
  Doze Mode was introduced in Android Marshmallow as a way to minimize battery drain while a user has been away from their device for a period of time
