AsyncTask use a static THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR to execute the task.
So all the task in the process will use the same executor no matter how many AsyncTask created. If serial executor used, that means
all task will execute one by one.


/**
     * An {@link Executor} that can be used to execute tasks in parallel.
     */
    public static final Executor THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR;

    static {
        ThreadPoolExecutor threadPoolExecutor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(
                CORE_POOL_SIZE, MAXIMUM_POOL_SIZE, KEEP_ALIVE_SECONDS, TimeUnit.SECONDS,
                sPoolWorkQueue, sThreadFactory);
        threadPoolExecutor.allowCoreThreadTimeOut(true);
        THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR = threadPoolExecutor;
    }
