https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager/
WorkManager is intended for tasks that require a guarantee that the system will run them even if the app exits, 
like uploading app data to a server. It is not intended for in-process background work that can safely be terminated if 
the app process goes away; for situations like that, we recommend using ThreadPools.

Worker: specifies what task you need to perform.
WorkRequest: represents an individual task.specifying things like the circumstances under which the task should run
  OneTimeWorkRequest or PeriodicWorkRequest
Example
  you're writing a photo library app, and that app needs to periodically compress its stored images

Chained tasks
  Your app might need to run several tasks in a particular order
   WorkManager allows you to create and enqueue a work sequence that specifies multiple tasks
