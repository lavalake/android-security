ActivityThread.runOnUIThread
A Handler allows you to post messages to be executed on the main UI thread. Activity#runOnUiThread(Runnable) is a convenience 
method that uses a Handler internally to post a Runnable

An AsyncTask is a utility class that uses a thread pool to execute tasks and provides helpful callback methods 
(i.e. onPreExecute, onPostExecute, etc.) that are guaranteed to be executed on the main UI thread (in other words, 
it abstracts the idea of Handlers from the developer).
