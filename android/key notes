1. processState
    getContextObject -> IServiceManager
      getStrongProxyForHandle(0)
    every service has it's own process and will create one instance of processState. ProcessState will open the binder device and
    mmap memory into kernel.
2. IPCThreadState
3. android_util_binder.cpp
    This file define the JNI method to java class BinderInternal BinderProxy
    Converstion to/from Java IBinder Object and C++ IBinder instance.
  
4. android_os_BinderInternal_getContextObject
    processState->getContextObject
5. Intent and ContentProvider are higher-level abstraction of Binder
6. message handler
    a reference of messanger send to other process using IPC. Messages are delivered to local handler.
    Great for efficient call-back from the service to the client
    message are by default handled by the looper thread
    all underlying communication is still based on Binder
