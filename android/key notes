1. processState
    getContextObject -> IServiceManager
      getStrongProxyForHandle(0)
    every service has it's own process and will create one instance of processState. ProcessState will open the binder device and
    mmap memory into kernel.
2. IPCThreadState
3. android_util_binder.cpp
    This file define the JNI method to java class BinderInternal BinderProxy
    Converstion to/from Java IBinder Object and C++ IBinder instance.
  
4. android_os_BinderInternal_getContextObject
    processState->getContextObject
5. Intent and ContentProvider are higher-level abstraction of Binder
6. message handler
    a reference of messanger send to other process using IPC. Messages are delivered to local handler.
    Great for efficient call-back from the service to the client
    message are by default handled by the looper thread
    all underlying communication is still based on Binder
7. Looper
8. binder thread pool
    every app main thread will have a binder thread pool when the process created
9. ActivityThread
    handlerThread
10. poolthread
11. thread TLS
12. activity manager service
    ActivityThread.attach() will attach a ApplicationThread to AMS
    bindApplication
    scheduleCreateService
    scheduleServiceArgs
