Android 3.0 is the first version of the platform designed to run on either single or multicore processor architectures. 
A variety of changes in the Dalvik VM, Bionic library, and elsewhere add support for symmetric multiprocessing in 
multicore environments. These optimizations can benefit all applications, even those that are single-threaded. 
For example, with two active cores, a single-threaded application might still see 
a performance boost if the Dalvik garbage collector runs on the second core. The system will arrange for this automatically."

1. the Dalvik VM indeed does use a tracing garbage collector, using a Mark and Sweep approach.
2. From Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and on, Dalvik was replaced with the Android Runtime (ART).
3. Improved garbage collection

4. Garbage collection (GC) can impair an app's performance, resulting in choppy display, poor UI responsiveness, and other problems. ART improves garbage collection in several ways:

  One GC pause instead of two
  Parallelized processing during the remaining GC pause
  Collector with lower total GC time for the special case of cleaning up recently-allocated, short-lived objects
  Improved garbage collection ergonomics, making concurrent garbage collections more timely, which makes GC_FOR_ALLOC events extremely rare in typical use cases Compacting GC 
  to reduce background memory usage and fragmentation
