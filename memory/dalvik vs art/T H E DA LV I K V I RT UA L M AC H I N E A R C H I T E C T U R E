In standard Java environments, Java source code is compiled into Java bytecode, which is stored
within .class files
On the Android platform, Java source code is still compiled into .class files. But after .class files
are generated, the “dx” tool is used to convert the .class files into a .dex,
Whereas a .class file contains only one class, a .dex file contains multiple classes
2.Zygote 
  Android uses a concept called the Zygote to enable both sharing of code across VM instances and
  to provide fast startup time of new VM instances.
  The Zygote design assumes that there are a
  significant number of core library classes and corresponding heap structures that are used across
   It also assumes that these heap structures are generally read-only
   
   The Zygote is a VM process that starts at system boot time
   
   In traditional Java VM design, each instance of the VM will have an entire copy of the core
    library class files and any associated heap objects. Memory is not shared across instances
