1. In this heap dump taken from a sample app, Long objects have a noticeable presence; while each object is not big by itself, 
there are so many that they occupy a large portion of the app’s memory in the heap. This is especially problematic for devices
running the Dalvik runtime. Unlike ART, which is the newer Android runtime environment, Dalvik doesn’t have a generational 
garbage collection, known to be more optimal for handling many small objects. As we scroll through News Feed and the number of 
objects grows, the garbage collection will cause the app to pause and sweep unused objects from the memory. The more objects 
that accumulate, the more frequently the garbage collector will have to pause the app, causing it to stutter and stall and 
making for a poor user experience.
