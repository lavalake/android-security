1. preformance
  a. array
  b. cache
  c. object
2. JNIEnv
  The JNI specification states that each JNIEnv is local to a thread.A JVM can rely on this assumption, 
  storing additional thread-local information within the JNIEnv. 
3. exception
4. Correctness Tip #5
Ensure the code does not make any JNI calls or block for any reason between calls to GetXXXCritical() and ReleaseXXXCritical().
5. Using global references incorrectly
6. Validating new code against the JNI specification
  Validate that a JNIEnv is used only with the thread to which it is associated.
  Validate that JNI Methods are not called within GetXXXCritical()'s ReleaseXXXCritical() section.
  For a method that enters a critical section, validate that the method does not return before it is released.
  Validate that there is a check for an exception after all JNI calls that can raise an exception.
  Ensure that all Get/Release calls are matched within each JNI method.
7. Analyzing the method trace
8. local reference overflow
