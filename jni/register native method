static JNINativeMethod gMethods[] = {
        {"stringFromJNI", "()Ljava/lang/String;",(void*)stringFromJNI},
};
For "(Ljava/lang/String);" a description, the function has no parameters,
the return value is String. In brackets is a parameter list, followed by the return value
Field Descriptor	Java Language Type
Z	boolean
B	byte
C	char
S	short
I	int
J	long
F	float
D	double
For complex types, a string describing the beginning with "L", to ";" the end, such as the Java String, in JNI described 
as"Ljava/lang/String;"
For arrays, "[" at the beginning, then describes the type, such as int[], in JNI described as "[I"; String[], corresponding
to "[Ljava/lang/String;"; if the array dimension increase one-dimensional, "[" add a, such as int[.], corresponding to the"[[I";
