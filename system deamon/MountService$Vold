Vold Daemon
MountService contains most system API that deal with volume manamgement, but it runs a system user so can not actually mount
and unmount disk volume.
Vold runs as root.
Vold exposed a local socket /dev/socket/vold and only root and members of the mount group
system_server inludes mount (GID1099), so MountService can access vold's command socket.
