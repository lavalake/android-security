https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_signing_request
The CSR contains information identifying the applicant (such as a distinguished name in the case of an X.509 certificate) which
must be signed using the applicant's private key. The CSR also contains the public key chosen by the applicant. The CSR may be 
accompanied by other credentials or proofs of identity required by the certificate authority, and the certificate authority may
contact the applicant for further information.
